A basic Setup Script intended for the use on an arch base system that i would like to use, like arch itself or something like endeavorOS.

For a clean yet simple arch setup i suggest using `archinstall` to install a `minimal` setup. you can also install the `Desktop` -> `Hyprland` profile and afterwards  running `setup.sh` to setup a basic but rather functional/useable hyrpland config.\
But this might install some other packages that are not accounted for or conflict with configured packages.
